Main program: SS_Main.m

Run segment by segment to 
1. Initilization
2. Iterative solve of NS equation 
3. Calculate the total stress, viscosity, etc., at the workpiece wall.

The program can be terminated once it is stable in result

After calculating the stress, the removal footprint prediction can be done by MRR_Cal.m, where the process properties can be adjusted.

To plot the data such as contour map, or pressure map, one can do it in  ProcessPlot.m
